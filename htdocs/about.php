                <h2>PASSION FOR SNEAKERS</h2><br></br>
                <p>A sneaker to many is simply a high or low shoe that is usually made of fabric such as canvas, 
                    with a rubber or synthetic sole. However, for “Sneakerheads” it is not just only
                     a canvas with a rubber or synthetic sole but, a door that’s opens a world of respect 
                     and satisfaction or even to a secondary market. 
                    <br></br>
                    We're covering history, science, pop culture, language, music, true crime, or entertainment, 
                    we help our audience feel smarter.

        <h4>INNOVATION</h4>
        <br></br>
        <p>We dare to design the future of sneakerheads. And the performance engineering of today. 
        We've got sneaker labs. Sneakers get the attention that goes into developing a jet engine. 
        Scientists and engineers are constantly searching for that extra inch to the jump, 
        the extra feet in the sprint, more grip, easier pivot, a lightness of being.
        <br></br>
        To make big leaps, we take big risks.
